# Node-Based-Pathfinding

Node Based Pathfinding is a free collection of functions for creating a two dimensional interconnected network of nodes for quick point A to point B pathfinding with minimal setup required.

A written tutorial on how to set it up is can be found [here](/docs/tutorials/getting-started).

You can read the [documentation](/docs/!general-info.md) for more information on how it all works.
